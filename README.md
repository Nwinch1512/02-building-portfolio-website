# 02-building-portfolio-website

## Description

This repository contains all files relating to the week 2 frontend coding bootcamp challenge of creating a portfolio webpage. I was motivated to build this webpage to showcase and share projects I'd worked on. I wanted to set this up to demonstrate my projects to potential employers, and others working in web development. This webpage provides information on my experience, skills and contact details in a central place. Creating this webpage enabled me to develop my CSS and HTML skills. In particular, I learnt how to apply flexbox and media queries to take into account different screen sizes.
